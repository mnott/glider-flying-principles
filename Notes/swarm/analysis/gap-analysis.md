# Gap Analysis - Missing PDF Pages

## Analysis Date: 2026-01-15

## Current State

### File 04: Induced Drag and Wing Geometry
- **PDF Pages:** 25-35
- **Ends with:** Navigation section
- **Last topics covered:**
  - Wingtip vortices
  - Induced drag
  - Aspect ratio
  - Wing planform
  - Winglets and tip devices
  - Wing washout
  - Ground effect

### File 05: Stalls and Spins
- **PDF Pages:** 51-54
- **Starts with:** Critical angle of attack and stall physics
- **First topics covered:**
  - Flight at high angles of attack
  - Critical angle of attack
  - Types of stalls
  - Spin mechanics

## THE GAP: Pages 36-50

**15 pages of content are missing between file 04 and file 05!**

## Expected Content (Based on PDF structure)

The missing pages 36-50 likely contain:
- **Chapter continuation:** More on wing geometry effects
- **Transition topics:** Bridge between induced drag and stalls
- **Performance topics:** Glide ratio, L/D ratio, speed polars
- **Additional aerodynamic concepts:** Possibly load factor, turning flight, or other dynamics

## Analysis Verdict

This is a CRITICAL gap. We need to:
1. Extract pages 36-50 from the PDF
2. Determine if they form one or multiple logical lessons
3. Create appropriate lesson file(s)
4. Renumber subsequent files if needed
5. Update all navigation links

## Next Steps

Need to analyze the actual content of PDF pages 36-50 to determine:
- How many separate topics are covered
- Whether they fit into one lesson or should be split
- What the appropriate numbering scheme should be
