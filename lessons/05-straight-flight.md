# 5. Straight Flight - Laws of Motion and Glide Performance (Le vol rectiligne)

**Reference:** PDF Pages 39-44 (Chapter 6)

## Introduction

Before we can understand the complexities of maneuvering, we need to master something that seems simple but contains profound physics: straight flight. Whether it's powered level flight or the elegant descent of a glider, straight flight is governed by Isaac Newton's laws of motion - principles that connect forces to movement in ways that aren't always intuitive.

For glider pilots, straight flight takes on special meaning. Without an engine, we're constantly trading altitude for distance, and understanding the mechanics of gliding flight - the force balance, the speed polar, and the concept of finesse (glide ratio) - is fundamental to everything we do. Every cross-country flight, every thermal exit, every final glide calculation depends on mastering these concepts.

The "why" behind this chapter: Newton's laws explain when and why an aircraft's motion changes (or doesn't change). The speed polar reveals the performance envelope of your glider - showing you the speeds for maximum distance, minimum sink, and everything in between. Understanding these isn't just academic - they're the foundation of efficient soaring and safe flying.

## 6.1 Laws of Motion - Newton's Three Laws

### 6.1.1 The Historical Context

In the 17th century, Isaac Newton revolutionized our understanding of motion. Before Newton, people thought objects naturally came to rest, that forces were needed to maintain motion. Newton showed this was wrong - objects maintain their motion naturally, and forces are needed only to *change* motion.

These insights, published in his *Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica* (1687), form the foundation of classical mechanics and are essential for understanding flight.

### 6.1.2 The First Law - Principle of Inertia

**Statement (simplified):**

*When a body is not subject to any forces, or is subject to forces whose resultant is zero (force equilibrium), its motion does not change.*

**What "motion that doesn't change" means:**

A motion that doesn't change is **rectilinear (straight) and uniform (constant speed)**. This includes:
- Objects at rest (zero velocity, which is constant)
- Objects moving in a straight line at constant speed

**The revolutionary insight:**

Newton said that the *natural* state of an object is not "at rest" but "unchanging motion." An object moving at constant velocity will continue moving at that velocity forever unless acted upon by a force. Rest is just a special case where velocity happens to be zero.

**Inertia explained:**

Inertia is the tendency of objects to resist changes in their motion. More massive objects have more inertia - they're harder to accelerate, decelerate, or turn. This is why it's harder to push-start a heavy aircraft than a light one.

**In aviation:**

The first law describes all **steady-state flight conditions:**

1. **Level cruise flight** - Thrust balances drag, lift balances weight, constant speed and altitude
2. **Stabilized glide** - Aerodynamic force balances weight, constant airspeed and descent angle
3. **Constant-speed descent** - In powered aircraft, thrust + aerodynamic force balance weight
4. **Ground roll at constant speed** - All forces (thrust, drag, friction, rolling resistance) in equilibrium

**Key insight for pilots:**

If your airspeed is constant, forces are balanced. If your climb rate is constant, forces are balanced. The **first law tells you when forces are in equilibrium** - not by measuring forces, but by observing that motion isn't changing.

### 6.1.3 The Second Law - Fundamental Law of Dynamics

**Statement (simplified):**

*When a body is subject to a non-zero resultant force, its velocity changes - either in magnitude (speed), or in direction, or both.*

**Mathematical form (for those interested):**

F = m × a

Where:
- F = resultant force (in Newtons)
- m = mass (in kg)
- a = acceleration (in m/s²)

**What this means:**

1. **Force causes acceleration** - A force doesn't cause motion, it causes *change* in motion (acceleration)
2. **Direction matters** - The acceleration is in the same direction as the force
3. **Mass resists** - For the same force, larger mass means smaller acceleration
4. **No force, no change** - Without a resultant force, velocity remains constant (first law)

**Types of velocity change:**

The second law covers all cases where motion changes:

**Change in speed (acceleration/deceleration):**
- Aircraft accelerating on takeoff roll (thrust > drag)
- Aircraft decelerating when power reduced (drag > thrust component)
- Glider accelerating in a dive (gravity component > drag)
- Glider decelerating after speed reduction (drag > gravity component)

**Change in direction (turning):**
- Banking in a turn (horizontal component of lift provides centripetal force)
- Pulling up in a climb (excess lift bends flight path upward)
- Recovering from dive (elevator creates pitch moment, changes direction)

**In aviation examples:**

**Takeoff acceleration:**
- Thrust > Total drag
- Resultant force is forward
- Aircraft accelerates down runway
- Speed increases from 0 to liftoff speed

**Establishing a turn:**
- Bank the wings
- Horizontal component of lift creates resultant toward turn center
- Flight path curves (velocity direction changes)
- Constant bank angle → constant turn rate

**Zoom climb:**
- Excess speed converted to altitude
- Initially: velocity is high, lift > weight
- Resultant force is upward
- Aircraft gains altitude while losing speed
- Eventually: forces rebalance at new, slower speed

**Key insight for pilots:**

Whenever you see or feel acceleration (speed change, direction change, or both), there's an unbalanced force. The second law explains *why* you need to bank to turn, *why* you accelerate when you push the nose down, *why* you need excess power to climb.

### 6.1.4 The Third Law - Action and Reaction

**Statement:**

*For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.*

Or more precisely: *When object A exerts a force on object B, object B simultaneously exerts an equal and opposite force on object A.*

**This law is less directly relevant to basic flight mechanics** but explains:

- Propeller thrust (propeller pushes air backward, air pushes propeller/aircraft forward)
- Jet engine thrust (hot gases expelled backward, create forward thrust)
- Control surface forces (you push stick, stick pushes back with equal force)
- Ground reactions during landing (aircraft pushes on ground, ground pushes up on aircraft)

### 6.1.5 Common Examples in Daily Life

**The cyclist:**

**Constant speed on level road:**
- Cyclist pedals just enough to overcome air drag and rolling resistance
- Thrust = Drag + Friction
- First law applies: forces balanced, motion doesn't change

**Accelerating:**
- Cyclist pedals harder
- Thrust > Drag + Friction
- Second law: resultant force forward → acceleration
- Speed increases until forces rebalance at higher speed

**Coasting to a stop:**
- Cyclist stops pedaling
- Thrust = 0, but Drag + Friction ≠ 0
- Second law: resultant force backward → deceleration
- Speed decreases, eventually reaching zero

**The sled on inclined plane:**

**Terminal velocity:**
- Sled slides down slope
- Initially accelerates
- Eventually reaches constant speed (terminal velocity)
- At terminal velocity: component of weight down slope = drag + friction
- First law: forces balanced, constant velocity

**Parachutist:**

Similar to sled:
- Initially accelerates downward (weight > negligible air resistance)
- As speed increases, drag increases (drag ∝ v²)
- Eventually drag = weight
- First law: terminal velocity reached, constant descent rate
- Typical terminal velocity with parachute: 5-7 m/s (18-25 km/h)

**These examples are exactly analogous to gliding flight!**

## 6.2 Level Straight Flight (Vol Horizontal Rectiligne et Uniforme)

### 6.2.1 Definition

Level straight flight at constant speed - also called **steady-state level flight** or **cruise flight**. This is the most common flight condition for powered aircraft.

**Characteristics:**
- **Rectilinear** - Straight flight path, no turning
- **Uniform** - Constant speed (constant TAS)
- **Horizontal** - Constant altitude, no climb or descent
- **Steady-state** - All parameters constant, forces in equilibrium

**Aircraft types:**
- Powered aircraft or motor gliders in cruise
- Glider being towed in level flight
- Glider in windshear exactly canceling its sink rate (rare!)

### 6.2.2 Force Equilibrium

Four forces act on the aircraft, as shown in PDF Figure 1:

1. **Thrust (T)** - Forward force from engine/propeller
2. **Drag (Rx)** - Rearward aerodynamic resistance
3. **Lift (Rz)** - Upward aerodynamic force perpendicular to flight path
4. **Weight (P)** - Downward gravitational force

**Equilibrium conditions:**

**Horizontal (along flight path):**
T = Rx (thrust equals drag)

**Vertical (perpendicular to flight path):**
Rz = P (lift equals weight)

**Why this makes sense:**

- If T > Rx → resultant forward → speed increases (second law)
- If T < Rx → resultant backward → speed decreases (second law)
- If T = Rx → no resultant → speed constant (first law) ✓

- If Rz > P → resultant upward → climb (second law)
- If Rz < P → resultant downward → descend (second law)
- If Rz = P → no resultant → level flight (first law) ✓

### 6.2.3 The Relationship Between Speed and Angle of Attack

Here's something non-intuitive: **you can fly level at many different airspeeds**. How?

**The key equation:**

Rz = Cz × (ρ/2) × v² × S

For level flight: Rz = P (constant for a given aircraft weight)

Therefore: Cz × v² = constant (for level flight)

**What this means:**

Different combinations of Cz and v can produce the same lift:

**Slow flight:**
- Low v (airspeed)
- Must have high Cz
- High Cz requires high angle of attack (α)
- Aircraft flies "nose up" relative to flight path

**Fast flight:**
- High v (airspeed)
- Must have low Cz
- Low Cz requires low angle of attack (α)
- Aircraft flies "nose down" relative to flight path

**Example:**

Imagine level flight at two speeds:

**At 80 km/h (slow):**
- Need Cz = 1.2 (high)
- Angle of attack α = 8° (nose up attitude)
- Higher drag (induced drag is high at low speed)
- Need more thrust to overcome drag

**At 160 km/h (fast):**
- Need Cz = 0.3 (low)
- Angle of attack α = 2° (nose down attitude)
- Higher drag (profile drag is high at high speed)
- Need more thrust to overcome drag

**At some intermediate speed (e.g., 120 km/h):**
- Cz and v are balanced optimally
- Total drag is minimum
- Least thrust needed - most efficient cruise

**Practical implications:**

1. **Slowing down in level flight:**
   - Reduce thrust slightly (to avoid climbing)
   - As speed decreases, must increase α (pull back on stick)
   - Maintain altitude by maintaining Rz = P
   - Eventually: more drag (induced), need to reduce thrust further

2. **Speeding up in level flight:**
   - Increase thrust
   - As speed increases, must decrease α (push forward on stick)
   - Maintain altitude by maintaining Rz = P
   - Eventually: more drag (profile), need more thrust to sustain speed

3. **Minimum drag speed:**
   - There's an optimal speed where total drag is minimum
   - This is the most fuel-efficient cruise speed
   - Corresponds to best L/D (lift-to-drag ratio)
   - For most aircraft: roughly 70-75% of maximum level flight speed

### 6.2.4 Power Required vs. Speed

For powered aircraft, understanding power required at different speeds is crucial:

**Power required = Drag × Velocity = Rx × v**

**Drag composition:**
- Induced drag: ∝ 1/v² (dominant at low speed)
- Profile drag: ∝ v² (dominant at high speed)

**The power required curve:**

```
Power
  ↑
  |     /‾‾‾ (high speed: profile drag dominates)
  |    /
  |   |  Minimum power speed
  |   |
  |    \___  (low speed: induced drag dominates)
  |
  └──────────→ Velocity
```

**Two important speeds:**

1. **Minimum drag speed** - Least drag, best L/D, maximum range
2. **Minimum power speed** - Least power required, maximum endurance
3. These are NOT the same! Minimum power is at slower speed than minimum drag

**For pilots:**

- **Maximum range:** Fly at minimum drag speed (best L/D)
- **Maximum endurance:** Fly at minimum power speed (slowest fuel burn rate)
- **Most efficient cruise:** Slightly faster than minimum drag speed (practical compromise)

## 6.3 Stabilized Glide Flight (Vol Plané Stabilisé)

### 6.3.1 Definition

For gliders, this is the fundamental flight condition - steady-state descent in still air.

**Characteristics:**
- **Stabilized** - Constant airspeed, constant descent rate (first law applies)
- **Gliding** - Descending trajectory, no thrust
- **Rectilinear** - Straight flight path
- **Forces balanced** - Resultant force is zero

**This is the glider's equivalent of level cruise flight!**

### 6.3.2 Force Equilibrium in Gliding Flight

In gliding flight, only THREE forces act (no thrust):

1. **Weight (P)** - Downward gravitational force
2. **Lift (Rz)** - Perpendicular to flight path (upward and slightly backward)
3. **Drag (Rx)** - Parallel to flight path (backward and slightly downward)

**The clever part:**

Rz and Rx combine to form the **total aerodynamic force R**.

In stabilized glide: **R = P** (in magnitude and opposite in direction)

**Force diagram (see PDF Figure 2):**

```
        Rz (Lift - perpendicular to flight path)
         ↑ ↗ R (Resultant aerodynamic force)
          |/
     ←────● Aircraft
        Rx (Drag - parallel to flight path)

          ↓
          P (Weight)
```

**The weight P can be decomposed into:**

1. **Component parallel to flight path** - This provides the "thrust" that accelerates the glider forward
2. **Component perpendicular to flight path** - This must be balanced by lift

**Equilibrium in glide:**

**Perpendicular to flight path:**
Rz = P × cos(γ)

Where γ (gamma) is the glide angle (angle of descent below horizon)

**Parallel to flight path:**
Rx = P × sin(γ)

**Key insight:**

The glider trades altitude for distance. Gravity provides the "thrust" component (P × sin γ) that exactly balances drag. The steeper the glide angle γ, the more gravity component is needed, meaning higher drag.

### 6.3.3 Glide Angle and Finesse (Glide Ratio)

**Glide angle γ:** The angle between the flight path and the horizontal.

**Finesse (f):** The glide ratio - how many horizontal units you travel per unit of altitude lost.

**Relationship:**

From the force balance:
- Rz / Rx = cos(γ) / sin(γ) = cot(γ) = f

Or more intuitively:

**Finesse = Horizontal distance / Altitude lost = L/D ratio**

Also: **f = Rz / Rx = Lift / Drag**

**For small angles (typical for gliders):**

tan(γ) ≈ sin(γ) ≈ γ (in radians) ≈ 1/f

**Example calculations:**

**Glider with finesse f = 40:**
- For every 1000m altitude lost, travels 40,000m = 40 km horizontal distance
- Glide angle γ = arctan(1/40) = 1.43° (very shallow!)
- In 1:40 ratio (1 down, 40 across)

**Glider with finesse f = 25:**
- For every 1000m lost, travels 25 km
- Glide angle γ = arctan(1/25) = 2.29°
- In 1:25 ratio

**Training glider f = 30:**
- 1000m → 30 km
- γ = 1.91°

**High-performance glider f = 50:**
- 1000m → 50 km
- γ = 1.15° (incredibly shallow!)

**Historical context:**
- Early gliders (1920s): f = 8-12
- Pre-war sailplanes (1930s): f = 20-25
- Post-war wood/fabric (1950s): f = 25-35
- Fiberglass standard class (1970s): f = 38-42
- Modern racing class (2000s+): f = 50-60

**The importance of finesse:**

Every percentage point of finesse improvement dramatically extends cross-country capability:
- f = 40: 1000m → 40 km range
- f = 44 (10% better): 1000m → 44 km range (4 km extra!)

For a 3-hour flight with 3000m altitude used, that's 12 km extra distance - potentially the difference between completing a task and landing out.

### 6.3.4 The Speed Polar (La Polaire des Vitesses)

The speed polar is the **most important performance diagram** for glider pilots.

**What it shows:**

A graph plotting:
- **Horizontal axis:** Airspeed v (km/h or m/s)
- **Vertical axis:** Vertical speed vz (sink rate, in m/s, negative = descending)

**For each airspeed, the polar shows the corresponding sink rate in steady glide.**

**Shape of the polar:**

The curve looks like a "bucket" or parabola:

```
Vz (m/s, sink rate)
  0 ├────────────────────────→ v (km/h)
    |   50    100   150   200
    |
 -0.5│     •B (min sink)
    |    /  \
 -1.0│   /    \___•C (best glide)
    |  /           \
 -1.5│ /               \
    | A (stall)          \
 -2.0│                      \
    |                         •
 -2.5│                          (high speed)
```

**Key points on the polar:**

**Point A - Stall speed (Vd):**
- Minimum flyable speed
- Occurs at Cz,max (maximum lift coefficient)
- Sink rate is high (poor glide angle)
- Typical for training glider: ~65-75 km/h
- **Never fly slower than this!**

**Point B - Minimum sink rate (Vz,min):**
- Slowest descent rate
- Best for staying up in weak thermals
- Allows maximum time aloft
- Typical speed: 75-85 km/h
- Typical sink: 0.55-0.75 m/s
- **Use in weak conditions (<2 m/s lift)**

**Point C - Best glide (Finesse max):**
- Tangent from origin to polar curve
- Best distance per altitude lost
- Corresponds to minimum drag speed (or best L/D)
- Typical speed: 90-110 km/h (depends on glider type)
- **Use for inter-thermal cruise in still air**

**Between C and high speed:**
- Trade efficiency for speed
- Used when you have excess altitude
- Or when you expect strong lift ahead
- Or to penetrate headwinds
- Sink rate increases rapidly!

**Finding key speeds on the polar:**

**Best glide speed:**
Draw a straight line from the origin (0,0) that just touches the polar curve (tangent). The tangent point is best glide. The slope of this line is the glide angle (1/finesse).

**Minimum sink speed:**
Find the point on the curve with the smallest (least negative) vz value. This is minimum sink.

**Speed for best penetration in headwind:**
Draw a line from a point on the negative horizontal axis (representing wind velocity) tangent to the polar. Not covered in basic training, but important for cross-country flying.

### 6.3.5 Effect of Wing Loading on the Polar

**Wing loading:** P/S (weight / wing area) in kg/m²

**What happens when you increase weight (water ballast):**

The entire polar "shifts" along a line through the best glide point:

**Heavier aircraft:**
- All speeds increase
- Stall speed increases (vd = vd,empty × √(P/P,empty))
- Minimum sink speed increases
- Best glide speed increases
- Finesse (f) remains approximately the same!
- Minimum sink rate (vz,min) gets worse (increases)

**Example (see PDF Figure 4):**

DG-800, 15m version:
- Empty (W/S = 38 kg/m²): Best glide at ~95 km/h, vz ≈ 0.60 m/s
- Ballasted (W/S = 45 kg/m²): Best glide at ~105 km/h, vz ≈ 0.70 m/s

**Why ballast in competition:**

1. **Higher cruise speeds** - Can fly faster with same finesse
2. **Better penetration** - Less affected by sink between thermals
3. **Aggressive flying** - Can "bash through" moderate sink
4. **But:** Worse climb rate in thermals (heavier = slower climb)

**When to use ballast:**

✓ Strong conditions (thermals > 3 m/s)
✓ Fast tasks
✓ Good weather forecast
✗ Weak conditions (thermals < 2 m/s)
✗ Blue days (no cu marking thermals)
✗ Late in day when thermals weaken

### 6.3.6 Finesse-Sol (Ground Glide Ratio)

In real flying, we don't fly in still air - there's always wind and moving air.

**Finesse (f):** Glide ratio in still air (from polar)

**Finesse-sol:** Actual glide ratio **over the ground**

**Wind effects:**

**Headwind:**
- Reduces ground speed
- Worsens finesse-sol
- Must fly faster than normal best glide to optimize
- In strong headwind: finesse-sol can be half of still-air finesse!

**Tailwind:**
- Increases ground speed
- Improves finesse-sol
- Can fly slower than normal best glide
- Finesse-sol can be 50% better than still-air!

**Sink/lift:**
- Sink (descending air): Worsens finesse-sol
- Lift (ascending air): Improves finesse-sol
- In strong sink: May be impossible to reach destination even though polar says you should make it

**Practical example:**

Glider with f = 40 in still air:
- **Headwind 20 km/h, flying at 100 km/h:**
  - Ground speed = 80 km/h
  - Sink rate unchanged = say 0.55 m/s
  - Finesse-sol ≈ 80/(0.55×3.6) ≈ 40 → but must fly faster to optimize
  - Actual finesse-sol with optimized speed: ~32-35

- **Tailwind 20 km/h, flying at 100 km/h:**
  - Ground speed = 120 km/h
  - Finesse-sol ≈ 120/(0.55×3.6) ≈ 60 (!)

**This is why wind planning is critical for cross-country flying!**

### 6.3.7 MacCready Theory (Brief Introduction)

For cross-country racing, the question becomes: **What speed should I fly between thermals?**

**MacCready theory** answers this using:
1. Expected thermal strength
2. Glider polar
3. Wind conditions

**Basic principle:**

- **Weak thermals:** Fly slowly (conserve altitude)
- **Strong thermals:** Fly fast (trade altitude for speed)

**Why:** If you can easily regain altitude in strong thermals, it pays to fly fast between them even though sink rate is high. If thermals are weak, you must conserve every meter of altitude.

**MacCready ring (variometer setting):**

Modern variometers have a **MacCready setting** that tells you optimal speed to fly for given thermal strength. This is advanced cross-country technique, beyond basic training, but important to know it exists.

## Summary / Zusammenfassung / Résumé

**EN:** Newton's laws of motion govern all flight. The first law states that when forces are balanced (equilibrium), motion doesn't change - explaining all steady-state flight conditions including level cruise and stabilized glide. The second law states that unbalanced forces cause changes in velocity (magnitude or direction) - explaining acceleration, deceleration, and turns. In level flight, thrust equals drag and lift equals weight; speed can vary by changing angle of attack to maintain lift equal to weight. In gliding flight, the aerodynamic force (lift + drag) balances weight, and the glider trades altitude for forward motion. Glide ratio (finesse) equals lift/drag ratio and determines how far the glider travels per unit altitude lost. The speed polar shows sink rate vs. airspeed, with three key points: minimum speed (stall), minimum sink (best for weak thermals), and best glide (maximum range in still air). Wing loading affects all speeds proportionally but leaves best glide ratio approximately unchanged. Ground glide ratio (finesse-sol) differs from still-air performance due to wind, requiring speed adjustments for headwinds and tailwinds.

**DE:** Newtons Bewegungsgesetze regieren den gesamten Flug. Das erste Gesetz besagt, dass wenn Kräfte ausgeglichen sind (Gleichgewicht), sich die Bewegung nicht ändert - dies erklärt alle stationären Flugzustände einschließlich Horizontalflug und stabilisiertem Gleitflug. Das zweite Gesetz besagt, dass unausgeglichene Kräfte Änderungen der Geschwindigkeit (Betrag oder Richtung) verursachen - dies erklärt Beschleunigung, Verzögerung und Kurven. Im Horizontalflug entspricht Schub dem Widerstand und Auftrieb dem Gewicht; die Geschwindigkeit kann durch Ändern des Anstellwinkels variiert werden, um den Auftrieb gleich dem Gewicht zu halten. Im Gleitflug gleicht die aerodynamische Kraft (Auftrieb + Widerstand) das Gewicht aus, und das Segelflugzeug tauscht Höhe gegen Vorwärtsbewegung. Das Gleitverhältnis (Finesse) entspricht dem Auftriebs-/Widerstandsverhältnis und bestimmt, wie weit das Segelflugzeug pro Höheneinheit fliegt. Die Geschwindigkeitspolare zeigt Sinkrate vs. Fluggeschwindigkeit mit drei Schlüsselpunkten: Mindestgeschwindigkeit (Überziehen), geringstes Sinken (am besten für schwache Thermik) und beste Gleitzahl (maximale Reichweite in ruhiger Luft). Die Flächenbelastung beeinflusst alle Geschwindigkeiten proportional, lässt aber das beste Gleitverhältnis ungefähr unverändert. Das Gleitverhältnis über Grund (Finesse-Sol) unterscheidet sich von der Leistung in ruhender Luft aufgrund von Wind und erfordert Geschwindigkeitsanpassungen für Gegen- und Rückenwind.

**FR:** Les lois du mouvement de Newton régissent tout le vol. La première loi stipule que lorsque les forces sont équilibrées (équilibre), le mouvement ne change pas - expliquant tous les états de vol stationnaires y compris le vol en palier et le vol plané stabilisé. La deuxième loi stipule que les forces déséquilibrées causent des changements de vitesse (magnitude ou direction) - expliquant l'accélération, la décélération et les virages. En vol horizontal, la poussée égale la traînée et la portance égale le poids ; la vitesse peut varier en changeant l'angle d'attaque pour maintenir la portance égale au poids. En vol plané, la force aérodynamique (portance + traînée) équilibre le poids, et le planeur échange l'altitude contre le mouvement vers l'avant. Le rapport de plané (finesse) égale le rapport portance/traînée et détermine la distance parcourue par le planeur par unité d'altitude perdue. La polaire des vitesses montre le taux de chute vs. la vitesse, avec trois points clés : vitesse minimale (décrochage), taux de chute minimum (meilleur pour thermiques faibles) et meilleure finesse (portée maximale en air calme). La charge alaire affecte toutes les vitesses proportionnellement mais laisse le meilleur rapport de plané approximativement inchangé. La finesse sol diffère des performances en air calme en raison du vent, nécessitant des ajustements de vitesse pour les vents de face et de dos.

## Questions / Fragen / Questions

### Q1: What does Newton's First Law state about motion and forces?

**A:** Newton's First Law (principle of inertia) states that when a body is not subject to any forces, or when the forces acting on it are in equilibrium (resultant force is zero), its motion does not change. A "motion that doesn't change" means rectilinear (straight line) and uniform (constant speed) motion. This includes objects at rest (special case where speed is zero) and objects moving in straight lines at constant velocity. In aviation, this explains all steady-state flight conditions: level cruise, stabilized glide, constant-speed climbs or descents.

**DE:** Newtons Erstes Gesetz (Trägheitsprinzip) besagt, dass wenn ein Körper keinen Kräften ausgesetzt ist oder wenn die auf ihn wirkenden Kräfte im Gleichgewicht sind (resultierende Kraft ist null), sich seine Bewegung nicht ändert. Eine "Bewegung, die sich nicht ändert" bedeutet geradlinige und gleichförmige (konstante Geschwindigkeit) Bewegung. Dies umfasst ruhende Objekte (Sonderfall, wo Geschwindigkeit null ist) und Objekte, die sich in geraden Linien mit konstanter Geschwindigkeit bewegen. In der Luftfahrt erklärt dies alle stationären Flugzustände: Horizontalflug, stabilisierter Gleitflug, Steig- oder Sinkflüge mit konstanter Geschwindigkeit.

**FR:** La première loi de Newton (principe d'inertie) stipule que lorsqu'un corps n'est soumis à aucune force, ou lorsque les forces agissant sur lui sont en équilibre (force résultante nulle), son mouvement ne change pas. Un "mouvement qui ne change pas" signifie un mouvement rectiligne et uniforme (vitesse constante). Cela inclut les objets au repos (cas particulier où la vitesse est nulle) et les objets se déplaçant en lignes droites à vitesse constante. En aviation, cela explique tous les états de vol stationnaires : croisière en palier, vol plané stabilisé, montées ou descentes à vitesse constante.

### Q2: How does angle of attack relate to airspeed in level flight?

**A:** In level flight, lift must equal weight (Rz = P). Since Rz = Cz × (ρ/2) × v² × S, and weight is constant, this means Cz × v² must remain constant. Therefore, different combinations of airspeed and lift coefficient maintain level flight. At low airspeed, you need high Cz (high angle of attack - nose up attitude). At high airspeed, you need low Cz (low angle of attack - nose down attitude). This is why you pull back to slow down (increase α to maintain lift at lower speed) and push forward to speed up (decrease α to avoid excessive lift at higher speed).

**DE:** Im Horizontalflug muss der Auftrieb dem Gewicht entsprechen (Rz = P). Da Rz = Cz × (ρ/2) × v² × S und das Gewicht konstant ist, bedeutet dies, dass Cz × v² konstant bleiben muss. Daher halten verschiedene Kombinationen von Fluggeschwindigkeit und Auftriebsbeiwert den Horizontalflug aufrecht. Bei niedriger Fluggeschwindigkeit benötigen Sie hohes Cz (hoher Anstellwinkel - Nase-hoch-Lage). Bei hoher Fluggeschwindigkeit benötigen Sie niedriges Cz (niedriger Anstellwinkel - Nase-runter-Lage). Deshalb ziehen Sie zurück, um langsamer zu werden (erhöhen α, um Auftrieb bei niedrigerer Geschwindigkeit aufrechtzuerhalten) und drücken nach vorne, um schneller zu werden (verringern α, um übermäßigen Auftrieb bei höherer Geschwindigkeit zu vermeiden).

**FR:** En vol horizontal, la portance doit égaler le poids (Rz = P). Puisque Rz = Cz × (ρ/2) × v² × S et que le poids est constant, cela signifie que Cz × v² doit rester constant. Par conséquent, différentes combinaisons de vitesse et de coefficient de portance maintiennent le vol horizontal. À basse vitesse, vous avez besoin d'un Cz élevé (angle d'attaque élevé - attitude nez en haut). À haute vitesse, vous avez besoin d'un Cz faible (angle d'attaque faible - attitude nez en bas). C'est pourquoi vous tirez en arrière pour ralentir (augmenter α pour maintenir la portance à vitesse réduite) et poussez en avant pour accélérer (diminuer α pour éviter une portance excessive à vitesse élevée).

### Q3: What is the force balance in stabilized gliding flight?

**A:** In stabilized glide (constant airspeed and descent rate), three forces act: weight (P) downward, lift (Rz) perpendicular to flight path, and drag (Rx) parallel to flight path. Lift and drag combine to form the total aerodynamic force (R), which exactly equals and opposes weight: R = P. Alternatively, weight can be decomposed into components: one parallel to the flight path (providing the "thrust" that balances drag: Rx = P×sin γ) and one perpendicular to the flight path (balanced by lift: Rz = P×cos γ). The glider trades altitude for forward motion, with gravity providing the force to overcome drag.

**DE:** Im stabilisierten Gleitflug (konstante Fluggeschwindigkeit und Sinkrate) wirken drei Kräfte: Gewicht (P) nach unten, Auftrieb (Rz) senkrecht zur Flugbahn und Widerstand (Rx) parallel zur Flugbahn. Auftrieb und Widerstand kombinieren sich zur gesamten aerodynamischen Kraft (R), die dem Gewicht genau entspricht und entgegengesetzt ist: R = P. Alternativ kann das Gewicht in Komponenten zerlegt werden: eine parallel zur Flugbahn (die den "Schub" liefert, der den Widerstand ausgleicht: Rx = P×sin γ) und eine senkrecht zur Flugbahn (ausgeglichen durch Auftrieb: Rz = P×cos γ). Das Segelflugzeug tauscht Höhe gegen Vorwärtsbewegung, wobei die Schwerkraft die Kraft liefert, um den Widerstand zu überwinden.

**FR:** En vol plané stabilisé (vitesse constante et taux de descente), trois forces agissent : poids (P) vers le bas, portance (Rz) perpendiculaire à la trajectoire de vol et traînée (Rx) parallèle à la trajectoire de vol. La portance et la traînée se combinent pour former la force aérodynamique totale (R), qui égale exactement et s'oppose au poids : R = P. Alternativement, le poids peut être décomposé en composantes : une parallèle à la trajectoire de vol (fournissant la "poussée" qui équilibre la traînée : Rx = P×sin γ) et une perpendiculaire à la trajectoire de vol (équilibrée par la portance : Rz = P×cos γ). Le planeur échange l'altitude contre le mouvement vers l'avant, la gravité fournissant la force pour surmonter la traînée.

### Q4: What is finesse (glide ratio) and how is it calculated?

**A:** Finesse (f) is the glide ratio - the horizontal distance traveled per unit of altitude lost in still air. It equals the lift-to-drag ratio: f = Rz/Rx = L/D. For small glide angles (typical for gliders), finesse also equals the cotangent of glide angle: f = cot(γ) ≈ 1/tan(γ). A glider with finesse 40 travels 40 km horizontally while losing 1000m of altitude (glide angle γ ≈ 1.43°). High-performance gliders achieve finesse of 50-60, while training gliders typically have finesse of 25-35. Finesse is the single most important performance metric for gliders, determining cross-country range and task completion capability.

**DE:** Finesse (f) ist das Gleitverhältnis - die horizontal zurückgelegte Strecke pro Höheneinheit in ruhender Luft. Sie entspricht dem Auftriebs-/Widerstandsverhältnis: f = Rz/Rx = L/D. Für kleine Gleitwinkel (typisch für Segelflugzeuge) entspricht die Finesse auch dem Kotangens des Gleitwinkels: f = cot(γ) ≈ 1/tan(γ). Ein Segelflugzeug mit Finesse 40 fliegt 40 km horizontal, während es 1000m Höhe verliert (Gleitwinkel γ ≈ 1,43°). Hochleistungs-Segelflugzeuge erreichen Finesse von 50-60, während Schulungssegelflugzeuge typischerweise Finesse von 25-35 haben. Finesse ist die wichtigste Leistungsmetrik für Segelflugzeuge und bestimmt Streckenflugreichweite und Aufgabenabschlussfähigkeit.

**FR:** La finesse (f) est le rapport de plané - la distance horizontale parcourue par unité d'altitude perdue en air calme. Elle égale le rapport portance/traînée : f = Rz/Rx = L/D. Pour les petits angles de plané (typiques pour les planeurs), la finesse égale également la cotangente de l'angle de plané : f = cot(γ) ≈ 1/tan(γ). Un planeur avec une finesse de 40 parcourt 40 km horizontalement en perdant 1000m d'altitude (angle de plané γ ≈ 1,43°). Les planeurs haute performance atteignent une finesse de 50-60, tandis que les planeurs d'école ont typiquement une finesse de 25-35. La finesse est la métrique de performance la plus importante pour les planeurs, déterminant la portée de vol de distance et la capacité d'accomplir les tâches.

### Q5: What is the speed polar and what are its key points?

**A:** The speed polar is a graph showing the relationship between airspeed (horizontal axis) and sink rate (vertical axis) in stabilized glide. It has three critical points: (A) Minimum speed/stall speed (Vd) - minimum flyable speed at Cz,max with high sink rate; (B) Minimum sink speed (Vz,min) - slowest descent rate, best for staying aloft in weak thermals (typically 75-85 km/h); (C) Best glide speed - tangent from origin to polar, maximum distance per altitude lost, corresponds to best L/D (typically 90-110 km/h). The polar reveals the entire performance envelope and is essential for speed-to-fly decisions in cross-country flying.

**DE:** Die Geschwindigkeitspolare ist ein Diagramm, das die Beziehung zwischen Fluggeschwindigkeit (horizontale Achse) und Sinkrate (vertikale Achse) im stabilisierten Gleitflug zeigt. Sie hat drei kritische Punkte: (A) Mindestgeschwindigkeit/Überziehgeschwindigkeit (Vd) - minimal fliegbare Geschwindigkeit bei Cz,max mit hoher Sinkrate; (B) Geschwindigkeit für geringstes Sinken (Vz,min) - langsamste Sinkrate, am besten zum Verweilen in schwacher Thermik (typisch 75-85 km/h); (C) Geschwindigkeit für beste Gleitzahl - Tangente vom Ursprung zur Polare, maximale Distanz pro Höhenverlust, entspricht bestem L/D (typisch 90-110 km/h). Die Polare zeigt die gesamte Leistungshülle und ist wesentlich für Geschwindigkeitsentscheidungen im Streckenflug.

**FR:** La polaire des vitesses est un graphique montrant la relation entre la vitesse (axe horizontal) et le taux de chute (axe vertical) en vol plané stabilisé. Elle a trois points critiques : (A) Vitesse minimale/vitesse de décrochage (Vd) - vitesse minimale pilotable à Cz,max avec taux de chute élevé ; (B) Vitesse de taux de chute minimum (Vz,min) - taux de descente le plus lent, meilleur pour rester en l'air dans les thermiques faibles (typiquement 75-85 km/h) ; (C) Vitesse de meilleure finesse - tangente de l'origine à la polaire, distance maximale par altitude perdue, correspond au meilleur L/D (typiquement 90-110 km/h). La polaire révèle toute l'enveloppe de performance et est essentielle pour les décisions de vitesse à voler en vol de distance.

### Q6: How does wing loading affect the speed polar?

**A:** Increasing wing loading (P/S) by adding water ballast shifts the entire polar: all speeds increase proportionally (including stall speed, minimum sink speed, and best glide speed), following the relationship v_loaded = v_empty × √(P/P_empty). Best glide ratio (finesse) remains approximately constant, but minimum sink rate worsens (increases). This is why ballast is used in strong conditions - it allows flying faster with same glide ratio, improving average cross-country speed and penetration through sink areas. However, climbing in thermals is slower due to higher weight, so ballast is only beneficial when thermal strength exceeds about 2.5-3 m/s.

**DE:** Eine Erhöhung der Flächenbelastung (P/S) durch Hinzufügen von Wasserballast verschiebt die gesamte Polare: Alle Geschwindigkeiten steigen proportional (einschließlich Überziehgeschwindigkeit, Geschwindigkeit für geringstes Sinken und Geschwindigkeit für beste Gleitzahl), entsprechend der Beziehung v_beladen = v_leer × √(P/P_leer). Die beste Gleitzahl (Finesse) bleibt ungefähr konstant, aber die minimale Sinkrate verschlechtert sich (erhöht sich). Deshalb wird Ballast bei starken Bedingungen verwendet - er ermöglicht schnelleres Fliegen bei gleicher Gleitzahl, verbessert die durchschnittliche Streckenfluggeschwindigkeit und das Durchdringen von Sinkbereichen. Allerdings ist das Steigen in Thermik langsamer aufgrund des höheren Gewichts, daher ist Ballast nur vorteilhaft, wenn die Thermikstärke etwa 2,5-3 m/s übersteigt.

**FR:** L'augmentation de la charge alaire (P/S) en ajoutant du ballast d'eau déplace toute la polaire : toutes les vitesses augmentent proportionnellement (y compris la vitesse de décrochage, la vitesse de taux de chute minimum et la vitesse de meilleure finesse), suivant la relation v_chargé = v_vide × √(P/P_vide). Le meilleur rapport de plané (finesse) reste approximativement constant, mais le taux de chute minimum se détériore (augmente). C'est pourquoi le ballast est utilisé dans des conditions fortes - il permet de voler plus vite avec le même rapport de plané, améliorant la vitesse moyenne de vol de distance et la pénétration à travers les zones de descente. Cependant, la montée dans les thermiques est plus lente en raison du poids plus élevé, donc le ballast n'est bénéfique que lorsque la force thermique dépasse environ 2,5-3 m/s.

### Q7 (Multiple Choice): A glider has a finesse of 35. Starting from 2000m AGL, how far can it glide in still air?

- A) 35 km
- B) 57 km
- C) 70 km
- D) 140 km

**A:** C) 70 km. Finesse = horizontal distance / altitude lost. Therefore, distance = finesse × altitude = 35 × 2 km = 70 km. This assumes still air with no thermals, sink, or wind - the theoretical maximum range from that altitude.

**DE:** C) 70 km. Finesse = horizontale Distanz / Höhenverlust. Daher Distanz = Finesse × Höhe = 35 × 2 km = 70 km. Dies setzt ruhende Luft ohne Thermik, Sinken oder Wind voraus - die theoretische maximale Reichweite aus dieser Höhe.

**FR:** C) 70 km. Finesse = distance horizontale / altitude perdue. Par conséquent, distance = finesse × altitude = 35 × 2 km = 70 km. Cela suppose de l'air calme sans thermiques, descente ou vent - la portée maximale théorique à partir de cette altitude.

### Q8 (Multiple Choice): Which point on the speed polar should you fly to maximize time aloft in weak thermals?

- A) Point A - Stall speed
- B) Point B - Minimum sink
- C) Point C - Best glide
- D) High speed point

**A:** B) Point B - Minimum sink. This speed gives the slowest descent rate, maximizing flight time from a given altitude. It's optimal for thermaling in weak conditions or when trying to stay aloft waiting for conditions to improve. Best glide (Point C) is for maximizing distance, not time.

**DE:** B) Punkt B - Geringstes Sinken. Diese Geschwindigkeit ergibt die langsamste Sinkrate und maximiert die Flugzeit aus einer gegebenen Höhe. Sie ist optimal für Thermikfliegen bei schwachen Bedingungen oder wenn man versucht, in der Luft zu bleiben und auf bessere Bedingungen zu warten. Beste Gleitzahl (Punkt C) ist für maximale Distanz, nicht Zeit.

**FR:** B) Point B - Taux de chute minimum. Cette vitesse donne le taux de descente le plus lent, maximisant le temps de vol à partir d'une altitude donnée. Elle est optimale pour tourner en thermique dans des conditions faibles ou lorsqu'on essaie de rester en l'air en attendant que les conditions s'améliorent. Meilleure finesse (Point C) est pour maximiser la distance, pas le temps.
