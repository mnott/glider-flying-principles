# 6. Control Surfaces (Les Gouvernes)

**Reference:** PDF Pages 55-64 (Part 2)

## Introduction

Control surfaces are the pilot's direct interface with the laws of aerodynamics—they're how we translate stick and rudder inputs into precise aircraft movements. Understanding how these surfaces work isn't just about mechanics; it's about understanding the forces, moments, and aerodynamic principles that make controlled flight possible.

This chapter covers the three primary flight control axes, how control surfaces generate forces through cambering airfoils, compensation systems that reduce pilot workload, and secondary controls like flaps and airbrakes that modify aircraft performance. For glider pilots, this knowledge is particularly relevant because high-aspect-ratio wings create unique control characteristics—especially adverse yaw effects that require coordinated use of ailerons and rudder.

**Why this matters:** Poor understanding of control surfaces leads to uncoordinated flight, which wastes energy (critical in gliders), creates uncomfortable flight for passengers, and can lead to dangerous situations like spin entries from cross-controlled stalls. Knowing how to use your controls efficiently makes you a safer, smoother, and more successful pilot.

## Aircraft Axes and Control Surfaces

### The Three Axes of Rotation

An aircraft can rotate around three axes, each controlled by specific surfaces:

**1. Pitch Axis (Axe de tangage - y'-y')**
- **Axis orientation:** Spans from wingtip to wingtip
- **Controlled by:** Elevator (gouverne de profondeur)
- **Movement:** Pitching up (nose up) or pitching down (nose down)
- **Purpose:** Controls angle of attack and airspeed

**2. Roll Axis (Axe de roulis - x'-x')**
- **Axis orientation:** Runs along the fuselage from nose to tail
- **Controlled by:** Ailerons (commandes de gauchissement)
- **Movement:** Banking left or right
- **Purpose:** Initiates and controls turns

**3. Yaw Axis (Axe de lacet - z'-z')**
- **Axis orientation:** Vertical axis through the aircraft's center of gravity
- **Controlled by:** Rudder (gouverne de direction)
- **Movement:** Nose swinging left or right
- **Purpose:** Coordinated turns, crosswind corrections

### Control Surface Nomenclature

**Fixed surfaces:**
1. **Fuselage (fuselage)** - Main body structure
2. **Wings (ailes)** - Primary lift-generating surfaces
3. **Horizontal stabilizer (plan fixe horizontal)** - Provides pitch stability
4. **Vertical stabilizer (plan fixe vertical)** - Provides directional stability

**Moving primary control surfaces:**
3. **Ailerons (ailerons)** - Located on outer wing trailing edge
5. **Elevator (gouvernail de profondeur)** - Hinged to horizontal stabilizer
7. **Rudder (gouvernail de direction)** - Hinged to vertical stabilizer

**Secondary control surfaces:**
8. **Flaps (volets)** - Modify wing camber for different flight phases
- Gliders: Full-span camber-changing flaps
- Powered aircraft: High-lift devices on inner wing sections

**Airbrakes/Spoilers (aérofreins)** - Increase drag and reduce lift for steeper descents

## How Control Surfaces Work

### Basic Aerodynamic Principle

When you deflect a control surface, you're changing the camber (curvature) of that surface's airfoil, creating a change in lift (∆Rz).

**The mechanism:**
1. Control input → Surface deflects
2. Surface deflection → Increased camber
3. Increased camber → Change in pressure distribution
4. Pressure change → Supplementary lift ∆Rz
5. Lift force × lever arm → **Moment of force** that rotates the aircraft

**Moment of force = Force × Lever arm**

The lever arm is the perpendicular distance from the force's line of action to the axis of rotation. This is why the elevator is so far aft—its distance from the center of gravity gives it powerful pitch authority with relatively small forces.

**Important consideration:** Any control deflection creates additional wake (turbulence) behind the surface. The supplementary lift ∆Rz comes with an unfortunate companion: supplementary drag ∆Rx. This is why good pilots use controls sparingly—every control input costs energy (airspeed or altitude).

### Alternative: All-Moving Surfaces

Instead of changing camber with a hinged surface, some designs change the angle of attack of the entire surface (gouvernail monobloc). This approach is:

- **Common on:** Elevator/stabilator systems
- **Sometimes used for:** Rudders in high-performance aircraft
- **Advantages:** More powerful at high angles of attack, cleaner aerodynamically
- **Design examples:** Many modern gliders use all-moving horizontal tails

**How it works:** The entire horizontal stabilizer pivots, changing its angle of attack relative to the airflow. This changes the lift force on the tail surface, creating a pitching moment about the center of gravity.

**Aerodynamic balance:** On all-moving surfaces, part of the surface extends ahead of the pivot axis. The aerodynamic force on this forward section creates a moment that partially opposes the moment from the larger aft section, reducing control forces.

## Control Surface Compensation

Control forces can be quite high, especially at high airspeeds. Various compensation systems reduce pilot workload.

### Aerodynamic Compensation

**1. All-Moving Surface (Gouvernail Monobloc)**

The pivot axis is positioned so that aerodynamic forces ahead of the hinge partially counteract forces behind it, reducing net control force required.

**Example:** All-moving horizontal stabilizer with the pivot point at approximately 25% chord. Forward section creates a "helping" moment that reduces the force needed to deflect the surface.

**2. Overhanging Compensation Horn (Bec Compensateur / Corne Débordante)**

A portion of the control surface projects forward of its hinge line, into the airflow.

**How it works:**
- When the main surface deflects down, the overhanging portion deflects up (and vice versa)
- Aerodynamic force on the overhang creates a moment that helps move the control
- The overhang essentially "pulls" the control surface in the direction of deflection

**Common on:** Rudders and elevators of light aircraft (e.g., Piper Super Cub tail surfaces)

**3. Trailing Edge Tab (Tab de Bord de Fuite)**

A small hinged surface on the control surface's trailing edge.

**Mechanism:**
- Tab deflects opposite to main control surface
- Tab deflection → small lift force
- This force helps deflect the main surface
- Effect: Reduced control force required

**Historical use:** Common on older gliders' elevators. Less common on modern designs with better aerodynamic balance.

### Mechanical Compensation

**Mass Balance Weights (Masses Compensatrices)**

Weights positioned to move the control surface's center of gravity to coincide with its hinge axis.

**Two configurations:**
- **Internal mass:** Weight inside the control surface, forward of hinge
- **External mass:** Weight on arm extending forward of hinge

**Purpose:**
- Eliminates control surface flutter (dangerous oscillation)
- Prevents control surface deflection due to G-forces
- Critical for safety at high speeds

**Why it's important:** Without mass balance, rapid pitch or yaw movements could cause the control surface to deflect due to inertia, potentially leading to flutter—a destructive oscillation that can tear the surface off.

## Trim Systems (Equilibrage)

Flying for extended periods with constant pressure on the controls is fatiguing. Trim systems allow hands-off stabilized flight.

### Fixed-Speed Trim (Spring Trim)

**Modern glider standard:** An adjustable spring system applies force to the control circuit.

**How it works:**
1. Pilot adjusts trim wheel/lever
2. Spring tension changes
3. Spring force offsets aerodynamic force on controls
4. At trimmed speed: zero stick force

**Advantages:**
- Simple, lightweight
- Pilot can still "override" with stick force
- Provides force feedback (gradient) for airspeed control

**Usage:** Trim for desired cruise speed. Stick-neutral position corresponds to trimmed airspeed.

### Adjustable Tab Trim

**Traditional aircraft system:** A small tab on the elevator can be adjusted in flight.

**Mechanism:**
1. Pilot adjusts trim wheel
2. Tab deflects slightly
3. Tab creates small force on elevator
4. Elevator assumes new neutral position
5. Aircraft maintains new attitude/speed

**More common on:** Powered aircraft and older gliders

### Flettner (Aileron Trim Tab)

A small ground-adjustable tab on one aileron corrects lateral imbalance.

**Purpose:**
- Corrects wing-heavy tendency (one wing flies low)
- Compensates for mass asymmetry (fuel in one wing, etc.)
- Adjusted on ground only by bending metal tab

**Why needed:** Even small mass or aerodynamic asymmetries can create constant rolling tendency. The Flettner eliminates the need for constant aileron pressure.

**Adjustment:** If left wing is heavy, bend the left aileron's Flettner tab slightly down. This creates slight lift that helps raise the left wing.

## Secondary Controls

### Camber-Changing Flaps (Volets de Courbure - Gliders)

High-performance gliders often have full-span trailing-edge flaps that can be adjusted to optimize the wing for different flight conditions.

**Flap positions and purposes:**

**Positive deflection (Braquage positif):**
- **Use:** Thermalling, takeoff, landing
- **Effect:** Increases wing camber → Higher Cz (lift coefficient)
- **Benefit:** Lower minimum speed, tighter turns in thermals
- **Typical setting:** +10° to +15°

**Neutral (Braquage nul):**
- **Use:** Moderate-speed cruise
- **Effect:** Baseline wing configuration
- **Benefit:** Good L/D across speed range
- **Typical setting:** 0°

**Negative deflection (Braquage négatif):**
- **Use:** High-speed inter-thermal cruise
- **Effect:** Reduces camber → Lower Cz, cleaner profile
- **Benefit:** Better L/D at high speeds, reduced induced drag
- **Typical setting:** -5° to -10°

**How flap settings optimize performance:**

Glider wings are designed for a specific optimal lift coefficient. When flying faster or slower than this design point, the wing operates less efficiently. Flaps allow the pilot to shift the entire wing's operating point:

- **Slow flight:** Positive flaps increase camber, allowing higher lift coefficient at lower speeds
- **Fast flight:** Negative flaps reduce camber, preventing excessive lift coefficient and drag at higher speeds

**Flap coupling with ailerons:** Many gliders automatically deflect ailerons slightly with flap movement. Small flap/aileron deflections improve roll control and response, particularly at lower speeds.

### Flap Setting Tables

Manufacturers provide recommended flap settings for different speeds and aircraft weights (with/without water ballast).

**Example - DG-800 S (18m version):**

| Flap Setting | Mass 340kg | Mass 370kg | Mass 400kg | Mass 440kg | Mass 480kg |
|--------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| +13° | to 70 kt | to 73 kt | to 76 kt | to 80 kt | to 84 kt |
| +10° | 70-79 kt | 73-83 kt | 76-86 kt | 80-90 kt | 84-94 kt |
| +5° | 79-88 kt | 83-92 kt | 86-95 kt | 90-100 kt | 94-104 kt |
| 0° | 88-119 kt | 92-124 kt | 95-129 kt | 100-135 kt | 104-141 kt |
| -5° | 119-141 kt | 124-147 kt | 129-153 kt | 135-160 kt | 141-167 kt |
| -9° | 141-VNE | 147-VNE | 153-VNE | 160-VNE | 167-VNE |

**VNE = Never Exceed Speed (Vitesse Ne à Excéder)**

**How to use:** Select the column matching your current aircraft weight (including water ballast). Use flap setting corresponding to your intended speed range.

**Important:** These are guidelines, not rigid rules. Experienced pilots adjust based on conditions (thermals strength, turbulence, etc.).

### High-Lift Devices (Dispositifs Hypersustentateurs - Powered Aircraft)

Powered aircraft use various devices to increase maximum lift coefficient, reducing takeoff and landing speeds/distances.

**1. Slotted Flaps (Volets à Fente)**

**Design:** Gap between wing trailing edge and deflected flap creates a converging slot.

**How it works:**
- High-pressure air from lower surface accelerates through slot
- Energized air feeds into boundary layer on flap upper surface
- Delays flow separation behind flap
- Allows greater flap deflection before stall
- Significantly increases Cz max

**2. Split Flaps (Volets d'Intrados)**

**Design:** Lower surface panel deflects downward, upper surface stationary.

**Effect:**
- Deflects airflow downward
- Increases lift coefficient
- **But:** Creates large turbulent wake → High drag coefficient
- **Use:** Primarily landing (drag helps slow aircraft)

**3. Fowler Flaps (Volets Fowler)**

**Design:** Flap moves aft on tracks while deflecting down.

**How it works:**
- Rearward movement increases wing area
- Downward deflection increases camber
- **Double benefit:** Both area and camber increase lift
- Most effective for reducing landing speed

**Modern implementation:** Many transport aircraft use double-slotted or triple-slotted Fowler flaps combining multiple principles.

**4. Leading Edge Devices (Becs de Bord d'Attaque)**

Various designs: Krueger flaps, slats, slots—all create a slot that energizes upper surface boundary layer.

**Effect:**
- Drastically delays stall
- Increases critical angle of attack
- Increases Cz max
- Reduces stall speed dramatically

**STOL aircraft:** Short takeoff and landing aircraft (like bush planes) use leading edge and trailing edge high-lift devices to achieve remarkably low stall speeds.

**Speed limitations:** High-lift devices create high structural loads. They can only be extended below specific speeds (typically indicated by white arc on airspeed indicator and specified in Aircraft Flight Manual).

**Effect on lift coefficient curve:**

The graph shows how various devices increase Cz max:
- **Baseline wing:** Moderate Cz max
- **Trailing edge flaps:** Higher Cz max
- **Leading edge devices:** Even higher Cz max, higher critical angle
- **Combined (leading + trailing):** Maximum Cz max, significantly reduced stall speed

### Airbrakes / Spoilers (Aérofreins)

**Purpose:** Increase drag and rate of descent—NOT primarily to slow down.

**Common misconception:** "Airbrakes slow the aircraft."
**Reality:** Airbrakes increase the descent rate by increasing drag coefficient (Cx). The glider reaches a new equilibrium at similar or only slightly lower airspeed but with much steeper descent angle.

**Primary use:** Controlling glide path on final approach to landing.

**Types:**

**1. Dive Brakes (Freins de Piqué)**

**Design:** Panels that deploy perpendicular to upper wing surface

**Effect:**
- Severely disrupts airflow over wing
- Creates large turbulent wake
- Dramatically increases drag

**Historical:** Common on early gliders, less common now

**2. Schempp-Hirth Type (Modern Standard)**

**Design:** Panels deploy from wing upper surface, sometimes from both upper and lower surfaces simultaneously

**Advantages:**
- Cleaner aerodynamics when retracted
- Powerful drag increase when deployed
- Doesn't severely affect lift
- Progressive control (partial deployment possible)

**Effectiveness:** On final approach, airbrakes allow the pilot to steepen or shallow the approach path precisely, compensating for wind conditions, thermals, or misjudged approach height.

**Safety note:** Airbrakes must be tested before every approach. Failure of airbrakes to deploy can result in overshooting the landing area.

## Special Phenomena in Gliders

High-aspect-ratio wings (long, narrow wings) create aerodynamic effects that are particularly pronounced in gliders.

### 1. Adverse Yaw (Lacet Inverse / Lacet Négatif)

**The problem:** When applying aileron to roll into a turn, the nose initially swings opposite to the desired turn direction.

**Why it happens:**

When banking right (right stick):
- **Right aileron:** Deflects UP → Decreases lift on right wing → Right wing drops
- **Left aileron:** Deflects DOWN → Increases lift on left wing → Left wing rises
- **But:** The down-deflected left aileron also creates MORE drag (∆Rx) than the up-deflected right aileron
- **Result:** Greater drag on left wing creates yawing moment to the LEFT (opposite desired turn direction)

**Why it's pronounced on gliders:** Long wings mean larger lever arm from aileron drag to aircraft centerline, creating stronger adverse yaw moment.

**Two practical examples:**

**Example 1:** Flying straight with slight bank. You correct bank angle with aileron only (no rudder). The visual horizon reference point moves faster in the wrong direction momentarily before the aircraft begins to level.

**Example 2:** Initiating a turn without rudder input. The nose initially swings away from the turn direction before the bank angle develops and the turn establishes.

**The solution:** **"Stick and rudder go together"** (Pied et manche vont ensemble).

Every aileron input must be accompanied by coordinated rudder input in the same direction. This is fundamental glider piloting technique.

- Roll right → Right stick + Right rudder
- Roll left → Left stick + Left rudder

**Coordination indicator:** The yaw string (or slip-skid ball) shows coordination quality. In coordinated flight, the string points straight back (or ball is centered).

### 2. Induced Roll (Roulis Induit)

**When it occurs:** Stabilized turns or spirals

**The physics:**
- In a turn, the outer wing travels faster than inner wing
- Faster-moving outer wing generates more lift
- Lift differential creates rolling moment that increases bank angle

**The effect:** In sustained turns, the glider tends to increase bank angle progressively if the pilot doesn't apply slight opposite (outside) aileron to maintain constant bank.

**Pilot action:** In steep spiral dives or sustained thermalling turns, hold slight outside aileron to prevent bank angle from increasing.

### 3. Induced Yaw (Lacet Induit)

**When it occurs:** Some turn conditions

**The physics:**
- Outer wing generates more lift, but also more induced drag
- Drag differential creates yawing moment opposite to turn direction
- Can cause the nose to swing toward the outside of the turn

**The effect:** May require slight inside rudder during turn to maintain coordinated flight.

**Note:** The interaction between adverse yaw, induced roll, and induced yaw is complex. Modern glider designs minimize these effects through:
- Differential ailerons (up aileron deflects more than down aileron)
- Frise ailerons (create compensating drag on upgoing aileron)
- Careful wing design and twist

## Questions / Fragen / Questions

### Q1: What are the three primary axes of aircraft rotation and which control surface controls each?

**A:** The three primary axes are:
1. **Pitch axis (tangage)** - spans wingtip to wingtip, controlled by the **elevator**
2. **Roll axis (roulis)** - runs nose to tail along fuselage, controlled by **ailerons**
3. **Yaw axis (lacet)** - vertical axis through center of gravity, controlled by **rudder**

Each control surface creates a moment of force about its respective axis, causing the aircraft to rotate around that axis.

**DE:** Die drei Hauptachsen sind:
1. **Nickachse (tangage)** - verläuft von Flügelspitze zu Flügelspitze, gesteuert durch das **Höhenruder**
2. **Rollachse (roulis)** - verläuft von Nase zu Heck entlang des Rumpfes, gesteuert durch **Querruder**
3. **Gierachse (lacet)** - vertikale Achse durch den Schwerpunkt, gesteuert durch das **Seitenruder**

Jede Steuerfläche erzeugt ein Drehmoment um ihre jeweilige Achse, wodurch das Flugzeug um diese Achse rotiert.

**FR:** Les trois axes principaux sont :
1. **Axe de tangage** - s'étend d'une extrémité d'aile à l'autre, contrôlé par la **gouverne de profondeur**
2. **Axe de roulis** - va du nez à la queue le long du fuselage, contrôlé par les **ailerons**
3. **Axe de lacet** - axe vertical passant par le centre de gravité, contrôlé par la **gouverne de direction**

Chaque surface de commande crée un moment de force autour de son axe respectif, provoquant la rotation de l'avion autour de cet axe.

### Q2: How does deflecting a control surface create force, and why is there an efficiency cost?

**A:** Deflecting a control surface changes the camber (curvature) of that surface, which changes its pressure distribution and creates supplementary lift (∆Rz). This lift force, acting at a distance from the aircraft's axis of rotation, creates a moment of force (force × lever arm) that rotates the aircraft. However, any control deflection creates additional wake turbulence, and the supplementary lift ∆Rz is accompanied by supplementary drag ∆Rx. This is why good pilots use controls sparingly—every control input costs energy.

**DE:** Das Ausschlagen einer Steuerfläche ändert die Wölbung (Krümmung) dieser Fläche, was ihre Druckverteilung ändert und zusätzlichen Auftrieb (∆Rz) erzeugt. Diese Auftriebskraft, die in einem Abstand von der Rotationsachse des Flugzeugs wirkt, erzeugt ein Drehmoment (Kraft × Hebelarm), das das Flugzeug dreht. Jedes Ausschlagen der Steuerfläche erzeugt jedoch zusätzliche Wirbelschleppe, und der zusätzliche Auftrieb ∆Rz wird von zusätzlichem Widerstand ∆Rx begleitet. Deshalb setzen gute Piloten Steuerungen sparsam ein – jede Steuereingabe kostet Energie.

**FR:** Braquer une surface de commande change la courbure (cambrure) de cette surface, ce qui modifie sa distribution de pression et crée une portance supplémentaire (∆Rz). Cette force de portance, agissant à une distance de l'axe de rotation de l'avion, crée un moment de force (force × bras de levier) qui fait tourner l'avion. Cependant, tout braquage de gouverne crée un sillage turbulent supplémentaire, et la portance supplémentaire ∆Rz est malheureusement accompagnée d'une traînée supplémentaire ∆Rx. C'est pourquoi un bon pilote doit faire un usage parcimonieux des commandes – chaque commande coûte de l'énergie.

### Q3: What is a mass balance weight and why is it critically important for safety?

**A:** A mass balance weight positions the center of gravity of a control surface to coincide with its hinge axis. It can be internal (inside the surface, forward of hinge) or external (on an arm extending forward). Mass balancing is critical because it prevents control surface flutter—a dangerous high-frequency oscillation that can destroy the control surface. Without mass balance, rapid pitch/yaw movements could cause the control surface to deflect due to inertia, potentially initiating destructive flutter at high speeds.

**DE:** Ein Massenausgleichsgewicht positioniert den Schwerpunkt einer Steuerfläche so, dass er mit ihrer Scharnierachse übereinstimmt. Es kann intern (innerhalb der Fläche, vor dem Scharnier) oder extern (an einem Arm, der nach vorne ragt) sein. Massenausgleich ist kritisch, weil er das Flattern der Steuerfläche verhindert – eine gefährliche Hochfrequenzschwingung, die die Steuerfläche zerstören kann. Ohne Massenausgleich könnten schnelle Nick-/Gierbewegungen dazu führen, dass die Steuerfläche aufgrund von Trägheit ausschlägt, was möglicherweise zerstörerisches Flattern bei hohen Geschwindigkeiten auslöst.

**FR:** Une masse compensatrice positionne le centre de gravité d'une surface de commande pour coïncider avec son axe de charnière. Elle peut être interne (à l'intérieur de la surface, en avant de la charnière) ou externe (sur un bras s'étendant vers l'avant). L'équilibrage des masses est critique car il empêche le flottement de la surface de commande – une oscillation dangereuse à haute fréquence qui peut détruire la surface de commande. Sans équilibrage des masses, des mouvements rapides de tangage/lacet pourraient faire dévier la surface de commande en raison de l'inertie, déclenchant potentiellement un flottement destructeur à haute vitesse.

### Q4: How do camber-changing flaps on gliders improve performance across different flight speeds?

**A:** Glider wings are optimized for a specific lift coefficient. Camber-changing flaps allow the pilot to adapt the wing profile to different flight conditions: **Positive deflection** (+10° to +15°) increases camber for thermalling and slow flight, allowing higher lift coefficient and lower minimum speeds. **Neutral** (0°) provides good performance at moderate speeds. **Negative deflection** (-5° to -10°) reduces camber for high-speed cruise, preventing excessive lift coefficient and reducing drag at high speeds. This allows one wing to perform optimally across the entire speed range from slow thermalling to fast inter-thermal cruise.

**DE:** Segelflugzeugflügel sind für einen bestimmten Auftriebsbeiwert optimiert. Wölbungsklappen ermöglichen es dem Piloten, das Flügelprofil an verschiedene Flugbedingungen anzupassen: **Positiver Ausschlag** (+10° bis +15°) erhöht die Wölbung für Thermik und langsamen Flug und ermöglicht höhere Auftriebsbeiwerte und niedrigere Mindestgeschwindigkeiten. **Neutral** (0°) bietet gute Leistung bei mittleren Geschwindigkeiten. **Negativer Ausschlag** (-5° bis -10°) reduziert die Wölbung für schnellen Streckenflug und verhindert übermäßigen Auftriebsbeiwert und reduziert den Widerstand bei hohen Geschwindigkeiten. Dies ermöglicht einem Flügel, über den gesamten Geschwindigkeitsbereich von langsamem Kreisen bis schnellem Streckenflug optimal zu arbeiten.

**FR:** Les ailes de planeur sont optimisées pour un coefficient de portance spécifique. Les volets de courbure permettent au pilote d'adapter le profil de l'aile à différentes conditions de vol : **Braquage positif** (+10° à +15°) augmente la courbure pour le thermique et le vol lent, permettant un coefficient de portance plus élevé et des vitesses minimales plus faibles. **Neutre** (0°) offre de bonnes performances à des vitesses modérées. **Braquage négatif** (-5° à -10°) réduit la courbure pour la croisière à grande vitesse, empêchant un coefficient de portance excessif et réduisant la traînée à haute vitesse. Cela permet à une aile de fonctionner de manière optimale sur toute la gamme de vitesses, du thermique lent à la transition rapide.

### Q5: Multiple Choice - What is the primary purpose of airbrakes on a glider?

A) To reduce airspeed for landing
B) To increase the rate of descent by increasing drag
C) To reduce lift for faster flight
D) To cool the aircraft structure

**A:** **B is correct.** Despite their name, airbrakes don't primarily slow the aircraft—they increase the rate of descent by dramatically increasing the drag coefficient (Cx). The glider reaches a new equilibrium at similar or only slightly lower airspeed but with a much steeper descent angle. This allows precise control of the glide path during final approach. The main use is controlling the descent rate and glide path angle, particularly on final approach to ensure the glider reaches the intended touchdown point.

**DE:** **B ist richtig.** Trotz ihres Namens verlangsamen Bremsklappen das Flugzeug nicht primär – sie erhöhen die Sinkrate durch dramatische Erhöhung des Widerstandsbeiwerts (Cx). Das Segelflugzeug erreicht ein neues Gleichgewicht bei ähnlicher oder nur geringfügig niedrigerer Fluggeschwindigkeit, aber mit einem viel steileren Sinkwinkel. Dies ermöglicht präzise Kontrolle des Gleitpfads während des Endanflugs. Die Hauptverwendung besteht darin, die Sinkrate und den Gleitpfadwinkel zu kontrollieren, insbesondere im Endanflug, um sicherzustellen, dass das Segelflugzeug den vorgesehenen Aufsetzpunkt erreicht.

**FR:** **B est correct.** Malgré leur nom, les aérofreins ne ralentissent pas principalement l'avion – ils augmentent le taux de descente en augmentant considérablement le coefficient de traînée (Cx). Le planeur atteint un nouvel équilibre à une vitesse similaire ou seulement légèrement inférieure, mais avec un angle de descente beaucoup plus raide. Cela permet un contrôle précis de la trajectoire de descente pendant l'approche finale. L'utilisation principale consiste à contrôler le taux de descente et l'angle de trajectoire, en particulier lors de l'approche finale pour s'assurer que le planeur atteint le point de toucher prévu.

### Q6: What is adverse yaw and why is it particularly important for glider pilots?

**A:** Adverse yaw (lacet inverse) is the unwanted yaw motion opposite to the desired turn direction when applying aileron. It occurs because the downward-deflected aileron (on the rising wing) creates more drag than the upward-deflected aileron. This drag differential creates a yawing moment toward the lowering wing—opposite to the turn direction. It's particularly pronounced on gliders due to their high-aspect-ratio (long, narrow) wings, which create a large lever arm from the aileron to the aircraft centerline. The solution is coordinated control: "stick and rudder go together" (pied et manche vont ensemble).

**DE:** Gegengier (Lacet inverse) ist die unerwünschte Gierbewegung entgegengesetzt zur gewünschten Drehrichtung beim Anwenden des Querruders. Es tritt auf, weil das nach unten ausgeschlagene Querruder (am steigenden Flügel) mehr Widerstand erzeugt als das nach oben ausgeschlagene Querruder. Dieser Widerstandsunterschied erzeugt ein Giermoment zum absenkenden Flügel – entgegengesetzt zur Drehrichtung. Es ist besonders ausgeprägt bei Segelflugzeugen aufgrund ihrer hohen Streckung (lange, schmale) Flügel, die einen großen Hebelarm vom Querruder zur Flugzeuglängslinie schaffen. Die Lösung ist koordinierte Steuerung: "Knüppel und Pedal gehen zusammen".

**FR:** Le lacet inverse (lacet négatif) est le mouvement de lacet non désiré opposé à la direction de virage souhaitée lors de l'application de l'aileron. Il se produit parce que l'aileron dévié vers le bas (sur l'aile qui monte) crée plus de traînée que l'aileron dévié vers le haut. Cette différence de traînée crée un moment de lacet vers l'aile qui descend – opposé à la direction du virage. Il est particulièrement prononcé sur les planeurs en raison de leurs ailes à grand allongement (longues et étroites), qui créent un grand bras de levier de l'aileron à l'axe longitudinal de l'avion. La solution est un contrôle coordonné : "pied et manche vont ensemble".

### Q7: Multiple Choice - In a sustained steep turn, what control input is typically needed to maintain constant bank angle?

A) Continuous inside aileron
B) Continuous outside aileron
C) Increasing back pressure
D) No control input needed

**A:** **B is correct.** In sustained turns, particularly steep spirals, the outer wing moves faster than the inner wing and generates more lift. This lift differential creates a rolling moment that tends to increase the bank angle (induced roll / roulis induit). To maintain constant bank angle, the pilot must hold slight outside (opposite) aileron to counteract this rolling tendency. This is particularly noticeable in tight thermalling spirals where bank angles are steep and sustained.

**DE:** **B ist richtig.** In anhaltenden Kurven, insbesondere steilen Spiralen, bewegt sich der äußere Flügel schneller als der innere Flügel und erzeugt mehr Auftrieb. Dieser Auftriebsunterschied erzeugt ein Rollmoment, das dazu neigt, den Querneigungswinkel zu erhöhen (induziertes Rollen / Roulis induit). Um einen konstanten Querneigungswinkel beizubehalten, muss der Pilot leichtes äußeres (entgegengesetztes) Querruder halten, um diese Rolltendenz auszugleichen. Dies ist besonders bemerkbar in engen Thermikspiralen, wo Querneigungswinkel steil und anhaltend sind.

**FR:** **B est correct.** Dans les virages soutenus, en particulier les spirales raides, l'aile extérieure se déplace plus vite que l'aile intérieure et génère plus de portance. Cette différence de portance crée un moment de roulis qui tend à augmenter l'inclinaison (roulis induit). Pour maintenir un angle d'inclinaison constant, le pilote doit tenir un léger aileron extérieur (opposé) pour contrer cette tendance au roulis. Cela est particulièrement perceptible dans les spirales thermiques serrées où les angles d'inclinaison sont raides et soutenus.

**EN:** Aircraft rotate around three axes controlled by primary flight controls: elevator (pitch), ailerons (roll), and rudder (yaw). Control surfaces work by changing airfoil camber to create supplementary lift, which generates moments of force about the aircraft axes. However, any control deflection creates additional drag, so efficient pilots minimize control inputs. Compensation systems (aerodynamic and mechanical) reduce control forces. Trim systems allow hands-off flight at selected speeds. Secondary controls include camber-changing flaps (gliders) that optimize wing performance across speed ranges, high-lift devices (powered aircraft) that reduce stall speeds, and airbrakes that increase descent rate. Gliders experience pronounced adverse yaw due to high-aspect-ratio wings, requiring coordinated "stick and rudder together" technique. Induced roll in sustained turns requires outside aileron to maintain constant bank. Understanding control surface aerodynamics enables efficient, coordinated flight with minimum energy loss.

**DE:** Flugzeuge rotieren um drei Achsen, die durch primäre Flugsteuerungen gesteuert werden: Höhenruder (Nicken), Querruder (Rollen) und Seitenruder (Gieren). Steuerflächen arbeiten, indem sie die Profilwölbung ändern, um zusätzlichen Auftrieb zu erzeugen, der Drehmomente um die Flugzeugachsen erzeugt. Jedes Ausschlagen der Steuerfläche erzeugt jedoch zusätzlichen Widerstand, daher minimieren effiziente Piloten Steuereingaben. Kompensationssysteme (aerodynamisch und mechanisch) reduzieren Steuerkräfte. Trimmsysteme ermöglichen freihändigen Flug bei ausgewählten Geschwindigkeiten. Sekundärsteuerungen umfassen Wölbungsklappen (Segelflugzeuge), die die Flügelleistung über Geschwindigkeitsbereiche optimieren, Hochauftriebsvorrichtungen (Motorflugzeuge), die Überziehgeschwindigkeiten reduzieren, und Bremsklappen, die die Sinkrate erhöhen. Segelflugzeuge erleben ausgeprägtes Gegengier aufgrund hoher Streckungsflügel, was koordinierte "Knüppel und Pedal zusammen"-Technik erfordert. Induziertes Rollen in anhaltenden Kurven erfordert äußeres Querruder, um konstante Querneigung beizubehalten. Das Verständnis der Steuerflächen-Aerodynamik ermöglicht effizienten, koordinierten Flug mit minimalem Energieverlust.

**FR:** Les avions tournent autour de trois axes contrôlés par des commandes de vol primaires : gouverne de profondeur (tangage), ailerons (roulis) et gouverne de direction (lacet). Les surfaces de commande fonctionnent en changeant la courbure du profil pour créer une portance supplémentaire, qui génère des moments de force autour des axes de l'avion. Cependant, tout braquage de gouverne crée une traînée supplémentaire, donc les pilotes efficaces minimisent les entrées de commande. Les systèmes de compensation (aérodynamiques et mécaniques) réduisent les forces de commande. Les systèmes de trim permettent un vol mains libres à des vitesses sélectionnées. Les commandes secondaires comprennent les volets de courbure (planeurs) qui optimisent les performances de l'aile sur les gammes de vitesse, les dispositifs hypersustentateurs (avions à moteur) qui réduisent les vitesses de décrochage, et les aérofreins qui augmentent le taux de descente. Les planeurs subissent un lacet inverse prononcé en raison des ailes à grand allongement, nécessitant une technique coordonnée "pied et manche ensemble". Le roulis induit dans les virages soutenus nécessite un aileron extérieur pour maintenir une inclinaison constante. Comprendre l'aérodynamique des surfaces de commande permet un vol efficace et coordonné avec une perte d'énergie minimale.
